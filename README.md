# Counter
This project is a counter. It's a way to temporarily keep track of any number between 0 and 100. 

I thought of it as something that could be useful to keep your score during a board game night: no more paper waste!

_You can try this project on [GitHub Pages](https://mem96.github.io/counter/)._

I engaged in this project as part of my learning journey on [Start2Impact](https://www.start2impact.it/).

## Functions

The counter is anything but _counter_-intuitive. (Yeah, I really felt the urge to include this pun).

The functions I implemented are:

* **Multiple operators:** Useful to move faster from a number to another.

* **Reset button:** The game ended and you want to start a new one? Don't bother pressing buttons all the way down to 0, you can easily start over with this button.

* **Reverse button:** Some games are meant to use subtractive scores. Therefore, I thought it might be useful to be able to start from the top. 


### Possibile future functions

There is still something I could add to this project in the future. Something I think might be useful is:

* **Multiple counters:** Multiple counters could cohexist in the same page, so that it can be used by different players. 

* **Label for counter(s):** What if I remember the current score but I forgot what I was keeping score of? Brutal. Not a problem anymore when labels are introduced. 

* **Mobile optimization:** I didn't really make an effort to make this project suitable for mobile phones, but I could make up for it in the future.

## About the code

I just started coding in JavaScript and this is my first real attempt. 

The code should be easy to read and it includes some comments to remind me and anyone else who might modify it what I was doing in that particular section.

I had a problem with modifying the CSS through JavaScript. I wanted the shadow to be in the same direction even when the reverse function is checked. 

It wasn't really hard to do that, but in this way the pseudo-class of <code>:active</code> didn't work anymore and I couldn't find a solution to this.

If anyone wants to correct this or add anything else, feel free to copy this project and push your changes.
